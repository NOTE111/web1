<h3><p>fallacy occurs when you consider

​what you have soaked up to belong to

​yourself.</h3><br> For instance,

you might think I've done studied

​the subject enough be accustomed to

​coming up with.

​Having said that,</p>
<p style="margin-top:60px;">do you for real know that?

According to The telling theory,

​The theme you have been studying is

not part of you until you can clearly

expatiate it to someone.</p>

So, make sure what you have studied

possible for bringing up out of your brain

​in a flash and explaining to others who you

are close to as well as yourself every time

you want to check your acquisition level of

​the topic.
